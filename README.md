# Lab Search Python Script

## Introduction

This Python script allows you to search for available labs and their occupation time based on specific criteria. It reads data from a CSV file and provides two search options: searching by time and searching for a specific lab.

**Python Code** : [Check Here](https://github.com/AiBJ/classes_availability_checker/blob/main/searchCode.py)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A CSV file named 'Academic-Affairs-First-term-2024.csv' containing lab data.

## Usage

1. Place the 'Academic-Affairs-First-term-2024.csv' file in the same directory as the script.

2. Run the script using Python.

3. You will be presented with a menu:
   - Enter 'T' to search for available labs at a specific time and day.
   - Enter 'L' to search for a specific lab.

4. Depending on your choice:
   - For option 'T': Enter the desired time and day when prompted.
   - For option 'L': Enter the lab number you want to search for.

5. The script will display the search results based on your input.

## Example

- To search for available labs at a specific time and day, select option 'T' and provide the time and day as input.
-          choose :T
           Time : 11:00
  
- To search for a specific lab, select option 'L' and enter the lab number.
-          choose :L
           enter the lab number : 11
